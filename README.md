# Context
At Cal Poly Pomona's MiniHack hosted by MHK, attendees were tasked with building a chatbot in Python using OpenAI's API. This is my submission.
This was programmed in Visual Studio Code.

# How to execute
- Open an empty folder in Visual Studio Code.
- Navigate to the Terminal drop-down menu in the top left, and click on "New Terminal".
- Open the terminal, and enter "git clone https://github.com/Eloto04/MHK-Nov-2023.git".
- In the terminal, enter "pip install --upgrade openai". This imports the openai module used by the chatbot.
- Enter your API key on line 4.
- Run the program and have fun!
